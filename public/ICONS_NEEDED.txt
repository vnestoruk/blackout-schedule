⚠️ PWA ICONS NEEDED ⚠️

To complete the setup, you need to add two icon files to this directory:

1. pwa-192x192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. pwa-512x512.png (512x512 pixels)

QUICK OPTIONS:

Option 1: Use PWA Builder
→ Go to: https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
→ Upload a 512x512 icon
→ Download and place files here

Option 2: Use RealFaviconGenerator
→ Go to: https://realfavicongenerator.net/
→ Generate icons
→ Download and place files here

Option 3: Create manually
→ Use any graphic editor (Figma, Canva, Photoshop)
→ Create 512x512 image with ⚡ or 💡 theme
→ Export as PNG in both sizes

ICON THEME SUGGESTIONS:
- Lightning bolt ⚡ (represents electricity)
- Light bulb 💡 (represents power/light)
- Ukrainian colors 💙💛
- Simple, bold design works best

For testing, you can use any placeholder images temporarily.
The app will work without icons, but won't install as PWA properly.
